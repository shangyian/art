Everyone who spoke to me that day was a tourist. They were mostly looking for
directions, and I felt obliged to provide some, despite being directionless and
confused.

Someday I will have enough money to commission a building that looks <i>exactly</i>
like this.

<i>materials: ink pen, ability to speak to tourists in freezing weather</i>
