In Athens, I had daily dose of <i>spanokopita</i> and <i>frappe</i>.

We took a short day-trip to the island of Aegina and right before it was time
for our return to Athens, I decided I absolutely had to have a gyro. If it weren't for a
slight snafu in the ship's schedule, we would've missed the last boat off the
island - all for my insatiable hunger!
