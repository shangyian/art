I once spent an afternoon drawing an architectural anomaly in the Presidio. A woman walking past saw my
drawings, and immediately started in on That Heated Gentrification Debate.

"It must be so hard," she said, almost pityingly, "Making a living in the City as an artist. I mean, the
prices here are just crazy. All those techies moving in, all that money floating around."

"Housing is terrible," I quickly agreed.

"And the way the city has <i>changed</i> - I mean, as an artist, what do you think of all this gentrification?"

"Well, I guess many of my childhood friends have left - they're scattered all over the world." Except their
departures had nothing to do with gentrification, because all of them had agency when they moved.
They chose to leave the Bay Area to pursue their passions, even if some of them grumbled about
housing prices while doing it. And let's be honest, who doesn't grumble about housing in the Bay? It's become
.

"That's terrible!" she exclaimed, "Tech people are the only ones who can afford the city now. How have you
managed to survive here?"

"Well," I said, smiling, "If you can't beat them, join them, right?"
