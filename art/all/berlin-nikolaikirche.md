<b>Everyone</b> who spoke to me that day was a tourist. They were mostly looking for
directions, and I felt obliged to provide some, despite being directionless and
confused and mostly a tourist myself.

I'd managed to cover every inch of my body with the exception of the hand that was gripping
 the pen. I could feel my hands growing numb over the course of the afternoon and eventually
 I had to call it quits. I felt like the tourists were laughing at my misery as they passed me,
 every one of them settling comfortably into a warm cafe and <i>laughing</i>.

Who draws during winter? Who moves to Berlin during winter?

Someday I will have enough money to commission a building that looks <i>exactly</i>
like this, waves and all.

<i>materials: ink pen, ability to speak to tourists in freezing weather</i>
