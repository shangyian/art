title: 'the ringbahn is no longer a ring'

<b>The Ringbahn had disintegrated into a fragmented mess</b>, so I took a
long walk around town. Somewhere along the way (smartphone snooping puts me not far
from Viktoriapark), I came across this abandoned zeppelin/blimp/spaceship thing in a
tiny park.

A more adventurous soul wouldâ€™ve crawled right into the middle of the
spaceship, but alas, my space exploration days are behind me.
