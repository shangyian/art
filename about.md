<h3><b>Bio</b></h3>

I'm a Berlin-based artist and illustrator who works with both digital and paper media.
I base many of my drawings on observations of everyday life, but frequently add in a touch
of the absurd. I have a passion for telling stories visually, with experience
as an illustrator for local publications.
